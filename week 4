I had a great time learning Blender. I had a hard time trying to get the colors to chow on my cube, but figured it out eventually.
Our TA did a great job leading the class this week and was very helpful.
I also worked on my first project, which was the clock  project, and wanted to make an hourglass that flipped every new hour. It was difficult trying to learn how to make it flip and get it to show the digital clock.
I used military time because it looked better.
