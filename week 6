I really enjoyed the use of code to design and control the fonts. 
The fact that we’re using code, which is text, to create the appearance of text was really cool. 
That was definitely one of the most impressive things for me. Another thing that I really enjoyed was the explanation of the fonts on the website and the coding language behind it. 
This week has definitely opened my eyes to using code differently and to its creative potential, not only for creating shapes but also for the overall look and feel of the design.
