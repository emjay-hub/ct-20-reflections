This week I really enjoyed learning how to make the art pieces animated and move.
The wall drawing, which I recreated, was squiggly lines that were asymmetric,  and so when they moved, it made it very satisfying to watch
It was really cool to learn how to do it, even though I struggled in the beginning 
I can't wait to work on my first official project in this upcoming week
