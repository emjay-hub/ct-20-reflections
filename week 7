I worked a lot on my second project.
I uploaded the aespa Drama poster for the second project and used code to slice it into a grid of tiles. 
I randomized the position of each tile so the image shifts and glitches every time it runs. 
This transforms the polished promotional poster into a fragmented, unstable remix generated through code.
